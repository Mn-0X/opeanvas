#To install Openvas and its dependencies on our Kali Linux system run the following command"
sudo apt install openvas


#The next step is to run the installer, which will configure OpenVAS and download various network vulnerability tests (NVT) or signatures.
#Due to a large number of NVTs (50.000+), the setting process may take some time and consume a lot of data.
#Run the following command to start the setup process:
sudo gvm-setup

#The gvm-setup command will take a long time to download all the vulnerabilty definitions (Notus files, NASL files, SCAP data, CRET-Bund data, gvmd data)


#OpenVAS will also set up an admin account and automatically generate a password for this account which is displayed in the last section of the setup output.

#Did you forget to note down the password? You can change the admin password using the following commands:
sudo gvmd --user=admin --new-password=passwd

#To create a new user
sudo runuser -u _gvm — gvmd — create-user=admin2 — new-password=12345
#To change the password of the existing user
sudo runuser -u _gvm — gvmd — user=admin — new-password=new_password
#Verify the InstallationYou can verify your installation with.
sudo gvm-check-setup

#Run the following command to start the services:
sudo gvm-start
#To stop the OpenVAS services again, run:
sudo gvm-stop


#After the configuration process is complete, all the necessary OpenVAS processes will start and the web interface will open automatically (In my case I had to open the browser manually). 
#The web interface is running locally on port 9392 and can be accessed through https://localhost:9392
